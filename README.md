# Mars Rover Image Search
This is a program written in mainly typescript that uses react and NASA's RESTful API's to find out what 
the different mars rovers were doing on certain days. I have made this program to help me with my frontend 
experience for the Microsoft Student Accelerator program.

## Getting started
Input your API key that you can get for free from NASA https://api.nasa.gov/ 
Then input your API key at MarsRoverImageSearch/my-app/src/App.tsx line 35
then use 
```bash
npm install
``` 
and 
```bash
npm start
``` 
to start the webapp
