# Mars Rover Image Search
This is a program written in mainly typescript that uses react and NASA's RESTful API's to find out what 
the different mars rovers were doing on certain days. I have made this program to help me with my frontend 
experience for the Microsoft Student Accelerator program.

You can see a live version of the website with this link https://maxcouling.github.io/MarsRoverImageSearch/
